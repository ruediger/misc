APL might be forgotten by now. But some of its functionality can be found in other programming languages especially in math centric environments.

Incomplete list of APL like functionality in other languages.

| APL | Description      | Mathematica                   | Octave/Matlab    |
|-----+------------------+-------------------------------+------------------|
| A⌽B | Rotate           | =RotateLeft[B,A]/RotateRight= |                  |
| ⍳B  | Index Generator  | =Range[B]=                    |                  |
| A↑B | Take             | =Take[B,A]=                   |                  |
| A↓B | Drop             | =Drop[B,A]=                   |                  |
| ⌊B  | Floor            | =Floor[B]=                    |                  |

| ⍴B  | Shape/Dimensions | =Dimensions[B]=               |                  |
| A⍴B | Reshape          | =Partition[B, A+]=            | =reshape(B, A+)= |
